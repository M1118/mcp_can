MCP_CAN Library for Arduino
==============
MCP_CAN library v1.1
This library is compatible with any shield or CAN interface that uses the MCP2515 or MCP25625 CAN protocol controller.
Baudrates 5k, 10k, 20k, 50k, 100k, 125k, 250k, 500k, & 1000k are confirmed to work using a Peak-System PCAN-USB dongle as a reference.

Modified to allow operation with either an 8MHz crystal on board or a 16MHz crystal. Only tested on 125KBPS CANBUS with MERG CBUS modules. Mark Riddoch.

Installation
==============
Copy this into your "[...]/MySketches/libraries/" folder and restart the Arduino editor.

NOTE: If you have an older version of the library (CAN_BUS_Shield) be sure to remove
 it from the libraries folder or replace the files with those in this library to avoid conflicts.


*Happy Coding!*
